## Introduction
The Public Quantum Network offers a unique opportunity for non-experts to engage with quantum concepts through visual demonstrations of light behavior using a polarimeter setup. These systems introduce foundational ideas from quantum mechanics, such as superposition and polarization, through photonic devices that allow users to observe and interact with light propagation.

For a more tactile and customizable experience, individuals could purchase photonic components and construct their own optical systems. Yet, the high cost of these instruments—often ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars—creates a significant financial barrier to public engagement.

To address this challenge, we propose an inexpensive, accessible alternative: a modular optical setup built using 3D-printed components and affordable optics. This approach replicates the same visual effects of standard photonic systems at a fraction of the cost and is intended for use at various nodes within the PQN project.

In this repository, both STL files and CAD files for the 3D-print design will be uploaded so that users can directly implement our setup or change it to their preferred dimensions. Links to the optics purchased are also uploaded.

## 3D-Printables

### Base
A cylinder with 1-inch diameter 

### Posts
The dimension is given as 1/2 inch in diameter with a height of 4 inches. Fits with the base when enough pressure is applied.  

### Mounts

1. Laser Mount  
   Fits laser with 11mm diameter
  
2. Lens Mount  
   Fits Lens with 1-inch diameter 
   
3. Retardation/Polarizer Mount  
   Fits Films with < 1 mm thickness
   
4. Beam Splitter Mount  
   Fits BS with 1 mm thickness

### Wheel

Attached to the waveplate that alters polarization

## Instruction
In this section, a step-by-step explanation on how to equip the optomechanics is presented.

### 1. Merging base with magnet
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/Magnet%2BBase.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
     Apply adhesive magnet to the bottom of the base.
</p>

### 2. Merging base and post
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/Post%2BBase.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
     Apply force gently on the post to merge with the base.
</p>

### 3. Merging Polarizer/Retardation Film and Mount
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/Film%20Mount.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
     Cut the film to a diameter of 1 inch. A crack in the mount will be just big enough to slide in the film.<br>
   * Make sure to characterize the optics to the desired basis
</p>

### 4. Merging Fresnel Len and Mount
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/Lens%20Mount.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
   Open the crack and gently slide the lens in. The clamping power of the filament will hold the lens in place.
</p>

### 5. Merging Mirror and Mount
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/Mirror.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
   Attach the adhesive side to one of the sides of the mount, then peel off the cover.
</p>

### 6. Merging Laser and Mount
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/laser.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
   Insert the laser to the mount hole. <br>
   *Recommend applying superglue for stability
</p>

### 7. Merging Beam Splitter with Mount
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/BS.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
   The mounts will have a hole that will allow you to connect to the post when applied enough pressure.<br>
   *Works with any mount
</p>


### 8. Merging Mount with post
<p align="center">
  <img src="./GIF/Mount%20to%20Post.gif" alt="Demo GIF" width="250"/><br>
   The mounts will have a hole that will allow you to connect to the post when applied enough pressure.<br>
   *Works with any mount
</p>
